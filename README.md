#DF Everywhere. 
*Play Dwarf Fortress in your browser.*

DF Everywhere is a web service that allows you to control your own Dwarf Fortress game from anywhere that you have a browser.

The decoupled nature of the connection allows for some options not available in regular Dwarf Fortress games:

* **Control your game from a another computer** – Run your game on your fastest computer while controlling it from your most convenient computer. This can be on your own network or while at a coffee shop.
* **Display your game publicly** – Allow anyone to view your game as you play it. Use this to show your friends the game or give a tutorials.
* **Share the controls to your game** – Either help a friend with their game or allow your friends to play your game while you are away. Everyone sees the same game screen and everyone can send commands at the same time.
